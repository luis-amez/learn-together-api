    question: `‘I saw a great film’

    The first sentence is in the past tense. Fill the gap in the second sentence to convert the first sentence into present perfect simple tense.
    <br/>
    <br>
    ‘I _____ a great film’`,
    options: ['Am seeing', 'Will see', 'Have seen', 'Could see'],
    correctAnswer: 'Have seen',
    explonation:'The correct answer is have seen. This is because ‘have seen’ is in present perfect simple tense. The other options, though grammatically correct, are not in the tense required.',

    question: `Fill the gap with a suitable question.
    <br/>
    <br>
    ‘There wasn’t enough paper in the printer, ______ ?’`,
    options: ['Are there', 'Is there', 'Was there', 'Were there'],
    correctAnswer: 'Was there',
    explonation:'Note that the statement is in the past tense and the question should be in the past tense as well. Moreover, ‘paper’ is singular, and the correct verb is ‘was’. It is not ‘were’ as this is used for plural.',

    question: `Fill the gap by using the appropriate preposition.
    <br/>
    <br>
    ‘No one was allowed to use any written materials _____ the exam.’`,
    options: ['On', 'Bye', 'Over', 'During'],
    correctAnswer: 'During',
    explonation:'Here, we want a preposition in relation to time, therefore ‘during’ is the appropriate word. The other words are not appropriate with reference to the context of this sentence.',

    question: `Fill the gap with the appropriate word from the following options.
    <br/>
    <br>
    ‘I intend to _____ to my boss about my salary.’`,
    options: ['Tell', 'Speak', 'Talk', 'Both options 2 and 3 are correct but option 1 is wrong'],
    correctAnswer: 'Both options 2 and 3 are correct but option 1 is wrong',
    explonation:'Both ‘speak’ and ‘talk’ are appropriate with reference to the context of the sentence. Option 1 is incorrect as it is the wrong usage. ‘tell’, ‘speak’, ‘talk’ and ‘say’ are very similar and we have to be careful while using these words.',
